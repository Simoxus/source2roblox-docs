## ‚ùì About

Source2Roblox is a super cool C# console application originally created by MaximumADHD that can:
- Rip data from Valve's game files (*.VPK, *.VMT, *.VTF, *.BSP)
- Compile that data into files that Roblox can utilize (*.RBXM, *.RBXL, *.MESH, *.PNG)

This program is not very user-friendly, but if you want to take up the challenge, you can attempt to get S2R up and running!

3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

4. Create a directory for you to clone your repositories in using File Explorer

2. Exit out of this script, and go to the next section.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setting your Arguments

1. Go to Solution Manager, and under the first item (Solution), you should find a item with a C# logo and the name `Source2Roblox`. Right-click on it, and select `Properties`.

3. Go to the Debug tab, and `Command line arguments` is where you can enter the parameters you want. They are listed below.

With the command line arguments set, press the `Debug` button to run the program and have it work some magic ü™Ñ

## üìÑ File Generation

- PNG files generated from `-vtf` will be sent to a new folder on your desktop called `ExamineVTF`
- OBJ/MTL files generated from `-map` will be sent to a new folder on your desktop called `SourceMaps`
- OBJ/MTL files generated from `-model` will be sent to a new folder on your desktop called `SourceModels`
- RBXL/RBXM/PNG files generated from either `-map` or `-model` will be sent to `%localappdata%\Roblox Studio\content\source`.

## üí° Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

   üì¶ Nuget Packages

   1. Go to `Solution Explorer`, and right-click on the first item (Solution)
   2. Restore `NuGet Packages`

### ‚ùå Errors

 Make sure you have rebuilt the Nuget Packages.

 You should not be getting errors unless you have entered invalid arguments or have made a typo in one of the scripts.
 If you are unable to fix it, please reattempt the üóúÔ∏è Setup.

### üÜïüì¶ Downloading New Packages

 Sometimes, you may get errors and warnings about missing packages. What fixed this for me on a new computer was going to `Manage Nuget Packages` in my Solution Manager, going to `Browse`, and downloading

     Newtonsoft.Json.Bson,
     Newtonsoft.Json.Schema,
     Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson
